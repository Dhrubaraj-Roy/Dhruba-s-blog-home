title: "My 25-Day Sleep Experiment: What I've Learned So Far"

It's been 25 days since I started experimenting with my sleep habits, and I want to share what I've discovered so far. We all know sleep is important—I won't bore you with the basics. Instead, let me tell you about my personal journey.

## The Research Phase

Before diving in, I spent time researching sleep experts like Matthew Walker and Dr. Andrew Huberman to understand the science behind quality rest. Their work helped me identify what I call the "3-Matrix Approach" to improving sleep based on my personal circumstances.

## My 3-Matrix Approach

After analyzing the research and my own sleep patterns, I've focused on three key principles:

1. **No caffeine after 3 PM**: Caffeine has a half-life of 5-7 hours, meaning half the caffeine you consume is still active in your system many hours later. Cutting it off by mid-afternoon has significantly improved my ability to fall asleep.
2. **No sleep or naps after 3 PM**: Avoiding late-day naps has helped maintain my circadian rhythm. When I was napping after work, I found myself tossing and turning at night.
3. **Mental decompression before bed**: To reduce the stress from daily work, I've started watching light comedies or nature documentaries. This helps create mental distance from work problems that might otherwise keep me awake.

## The Three Pillars of Sleep: QQR

Through my experiment, I've come to understand that sleep really depends on three factors, which I call QQR:

- **Quantity**: Getting enough hours of sleep
- **Quality**: Ensuring the sleep I get is deep and restorative
- **Regularity**: Maintaining consistent sleep and wake times

I'm happy to report that I've made good progress with quantity and quality. I'm consistently getting 7-8 hours of sleep and waking up feeling more refreshed than before.

## The Regularity Challenge

The final frontier in my sleep journey is regularity. This has proven to be the toughest aspect to master. Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day—including weekends—requires significant discipline.

I know consistency is crucial for optimizing my circadian rhythm, but social events, occasional work demands, and the temptation to sleep in on weekends make this challenging.

## Moving Forward

As I continue this experiment, my focus will be on improving the regularity aspect of my sleep. While it's difficult, I'm committed to making it happen because I've already experienced the benefits of better sleep in my daily energy levels, mood, and productivity.
